## Hello, GitHub!

Thanks for checking out the innards of [my website](https://meagher.co/). Here's what's going on:

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) graciously hosts my site.
- [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com) powers my DNS (and SSL ftw).
- Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets (a.k.a [Sass](https://sass-lang.com)) help make it pretty.
- And [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) does just about everything else.

There's not much more to it.
