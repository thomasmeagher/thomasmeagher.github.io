description: Experiments on combining markdown syntax and preview
---

Markdown is a boon for writing. I write posts on this blog with Markdown. It
allows me to specify formatting without taking my hands off the keyboard and
fiddling with my mouse.

In theory, I could write, edit, and revise a post in my text editor of choice,
then when it's ready, immediately hit publish. No need to look at a preview,
let alone the generated HTML. It's puzzling why I don't do exactly this.

Instead my workflow looks something like this:

1. Write in Vim.
2. Preview in a browser.
3. Switch back to Vim for revisions.
4. Repeat until done.
5. Add and commit changes, push to [GitHub
   repository](https://github.com/tmm/www).

Vim might be the wrong tool for the job. Modern Markdown editors these days let
you type of the left and preview on the right.[^1] Problem solved, right? In my
opinion, the split write-preview editor is really clunky. It duplicates content
on the screen and prevents you from just looking at the cursor.

More sophisticated editors, like [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer), do lite
inline preview: `*emphasis*` becomes _\*emphasis\*_, headings appear heavier,
list items maintain their indent across multiple lines, etc. This is better, but
it's redundant to show the syntax and preview at the same time since you can
assume one from the other.

So there are two options left: Write in a plain text editor and "render"
the preview in your head, or use a WYSIWYG

Write, read, revise, all in the same window, all in the same mode.
