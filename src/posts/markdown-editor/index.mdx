[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) makes writing for the web simple. It allows me to write and format in plain text, then, when I'm ready, publish by pushing to [GitHub](https://github.com/tmm/www). In theory, I could write an entire post without ever looking at the preview â€” let alone the generated HTML. Instead, my workflow looks something like this:

1. Write in Vim.
2. Preview in Firefox.
3. Switch back to Vim for revisions.
4. Repeat until done.
5. Commit and push changes.

Since I care a lot about how my writing looks (word wrap, block size, etc.), I do a lot of switching between Vim and Firefox. After every switch, I need find my cursor or the line I'm reading again.

It's tiring to switch back and forth so I decided to explore making my own editor based on the [GitHub Flavored Markdown Spec](https://github.github.com/gfm). There are a few features outside of the editor that are important, but don't matter until I can write and preview Markdown.

With that in mind, I did some research. I downloaded and tested an absurd number of editors. I didn't use any metrics to compare them other than how it *felt* to write with them. Often, how it felt depended on how an editor treated Markdown.

Markdown is difficult to work with because there isn't a [formal grammar](https://roopc.net/posts/2014/markdown-cfg/) so developers need to decide on guardrails for processing it. Before I detail my guardrails, it's worth walking through a few issues I have with existing Markdown editors.

We'll use the first paragraph of the [Markdown Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) as a test example.

```markdown
**Markdown** is a [lightweight markup language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_markup_language) with plain-text-formatting syntax, created in 2004 by [John Gruber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gruber) with [Aaron Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz). Markdown is often used to format [readme files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/README), for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create [rich text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formatted_text) using a [plain text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text) [editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor).
```

#### Redundant information

[iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) is the benchmark of Markdown editors. Among other features, it renders previews inline as you type (\*emphasis\* becomes _\*emphasis\*_) and has an optional preview pane for viewing the document's HTML view. In fact, most Markdown editors have these exact two features.

We can refer to this type of editor as a "split pane editor" since it divides the window into two panes. Often, the left pane is a [source code editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-code_editor) with a monospaced font, syntax highlighting, autocomplete, etc. while the right pane is a markup previewer for the compiled HTML.

Notice how iA Writer looks with the example Markdown from earlier:

![iA Writer with preview pane](./assets/ia.png)

The markup preview pane isn't a whole lot better than switching between Vim and Firefox since it duplicates content on the screen and requires shifting focus away from the cursor in order to see the preview.

The inline previews include syntax so URLs and other markup create dead space between words. This makes is difficult to naturally read text when editing or revising. Your eyes are forced to do extra work while traversing to distinguish text from syntax.

#### Block preview

Block preview editors, like [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/), add preview to the editor on a block-by-block basis. When you are editing a Markdown [block](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#block), it is displayed as plain text. As soon as the block loses focus, it is compiled into a preview.

<video autoplay loop playsinline>
  <source src="./assets/roam.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  <p>Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is
     a <a href="./assets/roam.mp4">link to the video</a> instead.</p>
</video>

This is a better than split-pane editors in that you don't need to look elsewhere to see a preview since writing and preview happen in the same document. The downside is that previews aren't real-time and can cause significant text reflowing when focus is toggled.

Previews only work when a block is inactive so switching between focused and blurred states causes syntax to reflow the text as it is shown and hidden. It creates a jumpy effect that makes it complex to perform an initial selection and maintain focus.

#### WYSIWYG

[WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) editors aren't really Markdown editors, but they are worth talking about. Editors, like [Dropbox Paper](https://www.dropbox.com/paper), support Markdown on input, but strip syntax characters once they transform them to their semantic meaning.

Despite stripping characters (which is really bad), WYSIWYG editors handle preview the best because you are writing in rich text/HTML, the language of Markdown previews.

***

Okay, none of these do exactly what I want. Some of them come close and are decent editors, but none break the wall between editing and previewing.

There are two important principles partially or fully missing: 1) Previews should be scoped to markup, and 2) Syntax should show up when you need it to and disappear when you don't. Kind of like this:

<video autoplay loop playsinline>
  <source src="./assets/mizaru.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  <p>Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is
     a <a href="./assets/mizaru.mp4">link to the video</a> instead.</p>
</video>

In the above video, I'm typing up the first paragraph of the using a no-frills editor I hacked up to experiment with these two principles.

Did you notice what's cool about it? (No shame in watching again.)

As I type and move around the editor, previews occur in real time and syntax surfaces based on the cursor/selection. In the same document, I can **read in rich text and write in plain text** without specifying a [mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(user_interface)) or do much of anything! It just works.

***

If you are unsure why on-demand syntax and real-time preview are major improvements compared to the block or inline editors we reviewed earlier, consider the paragraph from the video.

A paragraph with a bunch of links is a dramatic example, but when using Markdown, it's not uncommon for the plain text representation to drastically differ from the preview. [Connect back to principles]

After researching Markdown editors for a couple months, I found [HyperMD](https://github.com/laobubu/HyperMD). HyperMD is the best example that implements the two principles from earlier. Unfortunately, it's not maintained and it uses [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net), which is going through a [break-change rewrite](https://codemirror.net/6).

One of the founders of [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), a buzzy split-pane editor, [asked on the CodeMirror Forum](https://discuss.codemirror.net/t/implementing-wysiwyg-markdown-editor-in-codemirror/2403) how they could do something similar to HyperMD and were directed to use [ProseMirror](https://prosemirror.net/) instead.

There is at least one tricky caveat with RRPW: [Whitespace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_character). Markdown is used to generate HTML, which collapses whitespace by default. In plain text, you can add any number of spaces (leading and trailing), carriage returns, etc. though.

Also challenging to do certain things: Tables.

I created a [Are.na channel](https://www.are.na/tmm/mizaru) for all my research.

Thanks to [Justin Seymour](https://justin-seymour.com) for reading drafts of this.

It's built with [ProseMirror](https://prosemirror.net), TypeScript, and React. Email me (tom@meagher.co) if you want to chat more.

Another one, [Typora](https://typora.io/) is close second, but is still a little too WYSIWYG-ish for my liking.
