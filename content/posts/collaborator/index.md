I'm tired of working alone.

Since I started programming, nearly everything I worked on outside of work and
hackathons were solo projects. There are a few exceptions, but either timing
wasn't right or initial interest in a project quickly turned into indifference.

Traditionally, coding was a mostly solitary activity for me. I taught myself to code so I
didn't have a bunch of computer science classmates to experiment with. Rather
than put effort into finding someone to work with I just kept coding. It was
easier in the short term.

Now, I'm actively looking for a collaborator.

A collaborator is not a co-founder. I don't want to start a company right now. I
want to explore. A collaborator is someone you would continue working with if
the current project didn't work out. You help keep each other sane and
complement each other.

Jobs and Woz were collaborators, turned co-founders.[^1] They did a bunch of
projects before Apple ([blue boxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_box),
Atari circuit boards, etc). They explored their interests and couldn't *not*
work together. If Apple wasn't a success, maybe they would have contently
tinkered away in garages forever together.

I'm not looking for much in a potential collaborator. Someone that has wonky
ideas and enthusiasm is preferred. Previous design or engineering skills would be nice,
but aren't that important. Location doesn't matter, but I'm in NYC.

Most of our time would be spent getting to know each other and exploring things
one or both of us are interested in. We would exchange excited text messages at
random times about an idea one of us just had on the subway, etc.

If this sounds like something you are interested in, or have a friend that might
be, send me an email or Twitter DM so we can start chatting. Even if we don't
end up working together, I love meeting people on the Internet.
